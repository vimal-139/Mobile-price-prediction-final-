Mobile Price Prediction Classification Machine Learning Project
This project is a classification machine learning project that aims to predict the price range of mobile devices. It uses various features such as battery power, camera quality, and RAM size to predict the price range of a mobile device.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is obtained from almabetter. It contains 2,000 mobile devices with 20 features including price range as the target variable.

Requirements
To run this project, you need to install the following libraries:

Pandas
Numpy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
You can install these libraries by running the following command:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
Usage
To use this project, simply download or clone the repository to your local machine. Then, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:css
python main.py
This will train the machine learning model and output the accuracy score of the model.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms to predict the price range of mobile devices based on various features. The trained model can be used to predict the price range of new mobile devices with similar features.
